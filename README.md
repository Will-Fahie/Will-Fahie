Hi, Iâ€™m @Will-Fahie. I'm no "master programmer", but am an "aspiring programmer". I'm always learning more and striving to expand my knowledge and experience.

My experience is mostly Python-based, however I've done some work with C++, Swift, HTML and CSS.

I'm interested in Machine Learning and Data Science. The concept of computers being able to recognise patterns and make human-like decisions fascinates me.
